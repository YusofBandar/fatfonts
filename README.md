# fatfonts

FatFonts is a graphical technique conceived and developed by Miguel Nacenta, Uta Hinrichs, and Sheelagh Carpendale. See http://fatfonts.org/ more info. This repo uses d3 to take any 2d array of values and outputs fatfonts. 


### Structure

`font.js` defines a new font type, path to svg files and how to position nested digits
`fatfonts.js` takes a 2d array of values, an font type and outputs position and data size data for each value
`draw.js` takes 2d array of position data and draws fatfonts visulisation either as a svg or to canvas
